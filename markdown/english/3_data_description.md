You have at your disposal 5 files : 

- **X_train.csv** : Contains the 1940 unique IDs of the training molecules along with their corresponding SMILES representations.
- **y_train.csv** : Contains the 1940 unique IDs of the training molecules and their associated labels for the three properties (Y1, Y2, and Y3).
- **X_test.csv** : Contains the 486 unique IDs of the test molecules along with their SMILES representations.
- **random_submission_example.csv** : Provides an example of a submission in the correct format.
- **supplementary_files** : Includes a notebook introducing the challenge and replicating the baseline score.

You will find different columns in the tabular files : 
- **ID** : Unique identification numbers for the molecules.
- **SMILES** : SMILES representation of the molecules.
- **Y1** : Labels for the first property.
- **Y2** : Labels for the second property.
- **Y3** : Labels for the third property.
