The challenge proposed here is a **supervised multi-label classification** problem, the objective being to predict the ADMET profile on three properties of various molecules. For each property, a value of 1 indicates that the property falls within an optimal range, while a value of 0 signifies that it does not. These binary labels are derived based on specific thresholds applied to the experimental data used to generate the dataset. Participants are tasked with **developing predictive models** to classify compounds accordingly, aiding in the identification of candidates with **favorable ADMET profiles** and enhancing the efficiency of the drug discovery process.

In the attached **X_train.csv** and **X_test.csv** files, molecules are represented using the **SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System)** format, which encodes molecular structures as strings. While it's possible to work directly with SMILES, they can also be converted into **molecular graphs** or **molecular fingerprints**. Fingerprints are binary vectors that capture the presence or absence of specific chemical features, such as functional groups, atom types, bonds, or other molecular properties. This is a common method for encoding the chemical information of a molecule, and in the introductory notebook, fingerprints were used to generate the baseline score.
